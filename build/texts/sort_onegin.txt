When comes my moment to untether?
When Eugene's turn for salutation
Whenever nyanya had collectedfor Olga, on the spreading lawn,
when, from behind the doorwayhidden
when galloping at headlong pace
when he arrived; not in the slightest:
when hourly we ourselves betrayed it,
When I defected from their union
when, in pale sky, the stars'procession
when in the park, in the all?e
when night patrol's a perilous calling;
when not quite eighteen yearsof age.
when, on the plain, green herbs are massed,
When progress and amelioration
when shall I start on my escape?
when suddenly I saw this treasure
when we begin to talk of verse);
When we draw a fellow in,
when we see him from afar,
When we've retreated to the banner
where admonitions are pronounced,
where are distress, commiseration?
where are the reveries this time,
Where are you? come -- and myown right
where a sharp nail has made adent.
where can we find your equal?Dmitriev
where civil treacheries are rife,
where did that glum eccentricgo,
where dwelt this child of inspiration,
where every day a bloodstained shade
where fate had fixed our confrontation,
where flows a little glittering brook,
where folded arms are tightlypressed.
where her security's completeRisen with earliest rays of dawning,
where, in a cab, and furious hurry,
Where is the fire that once ignited,
where master used to sit alone.
where nowadays I'm soundly trounced,
where scribbling friends haveinterjected
where (standard rhyme) are youth and fleetness?
where's the high aim, the ardent sense
where Tanya now confronts Eugene.
where the prize-boy of fashion's college
Where to, God knows. The trail is dead.
where two old pinetrees standunited:
whether from heaven or from hell,
whether it goes careering past,
Whether the arrow has my number,
which has recalled, without precision,
which held him silently subjected,
which I myself won't praise or blame
which, listening with some condescension,
which smilingly your friend, supported
which with a blush he leaves unread.
while a mazurka holds the crowd;
while dear Tatyana's youth grows dimmer:
while floors would split fromcrash of heel,
while in the hut a girl is singing;
While Lensky'd long been meditating
while, marmot-like, he hibernated --
while men, all sombre, all the same,
while odes have high and noble aims...''
while Petersburg's already rousing,
while she's from top to toe surveyed;
While under the connubial banner
