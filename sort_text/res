Already borne down by regret,he almost begs for absolutionhe trembles, knows not what to tell;
Already now the talk was thriving
Already, in exultant fashion,he watched the guests and, ashe dined,
Always our fervid hero tendedpure passion's flame, and in a trice
Amidst the hills, down in that valley,
An unknown yard, she sees from thence,
And Eugene? half-awake, half-drowsing,
And Ivan Petushk?v; no, neverPikht?n, of the Hussars, was here;
And every minute his lorgnette
And every morning I awake

And from the nearby Army station
And he remembers, in the quiet

And home was now their destination;

And in their daughters' closeembraces
And just here, in the window-nook,
And long, as if through miststhat spurted,
And my companion, so mysterious,
And not because she'd read him, either,
And now the door is opened wide,
And now the two opponents doff
And now, monotonously dashinglike mindless youth, the waltz goes by
And now there's gradually beginning
And now, my friends, I hear from you
And of the cupboards, one contains
And our young poet -- Olga fired him
And so, at last, feature by feature,
And someone's heart will feela quiver,
And suddenly her radiance lighted
And the sly baseness, fit to throttle,
And so they lived, two ageingmortals,
And then she broods and mopesfor good,
And then, to part us in full measure,
And what's more, they're so supercilious,
And while with all despatch he's dressing
And with a smile the world caressed us:
And yet, although it's past conveying,
Another had the skill to ravish
Another page of recollection:sometimes, in reverie's sacred land,
Another!... No, another neverin all the world could take my heart!

But I was simply not intendedfor happiness -- that alien role.
But I'm denied this: all for you
But come, thou youthful inspiration,
But dinner's served, so two by two
But don't be cross, my darling friend,
But ever stranger and more fearful:
But finally she heaved a yearning
But friendship, as between our heroes,
But from the hero of my tale,just at this crisis of his gale,
But go he won't: for him, a letter
But he could draw a joking moral,
But he's mistaken: Eugene's lying
But he, by sad and rocky wayswith heart that's grown unused to praise,
But here, with our congratulation
But how she jumped, when in this hovel
But in that desert his attainments
But it was passion that preempted
But it's the talent for concealing
But my Eugene that night directed
But not today. Although I dearly

But now Aurora's crimson fingers
But now Vladimir's doubts arestill:
But now our roads are bad, the ages
But now the radiance of the moon
But now they're near. Alreadygleaming
But now! what brings you to my feet?

But onward, onward with my story!

But then, oblivious of the city,
But there'll be such a rout and scrabble
But to the garden, to the scene
But what about Eugene? With reason
But when a later age has found us,
But when the hour of youthfulpassion
But where, mid tragic storms that rend her,
But while she roams in thought, not caring
But you perhaps find no attraction
But you're not sociable, theysay:
But you, blest husbands, to the end
But you, grand tomes I loathewith passion,
But, as it is, this pied collection

Happy a hundredfold, whoever
Happy is he who's known its fretful
He asks. She can't accept. Why ever?
He could have spoken without harming,
He cursed Theocritus and Homer,
He deemed, in general, letters vain,
He destined Olga's hand for me,
He finds the shock beyond allbearing:
He drained his glass down to the end
He followed them without illusion,
He found them in some old collection,
He gave this figure -- loved with passion,
He gave his arm. In sad abstraction,
He gave three balls a year, and rather
He got so used to this immersion,
He lacked the slightest predilection
He looks, and answers: ``Agafon.''4
He mounts the sledge, with daylight fading:
He nods -- they start to fussand truckle;
He opens up a door. What's that
He reads to Olga on occasion,for her improvement, a roman,of moralistical persuasion,
He rings at once, and what a scurry!
He roamed the world, his lyrebehind him;
He sang of grief and parting-time,
He sang of love, to love subjected,
He saw the sad girl's trembling state,
He sees: in slush, stretched out and keeping
He lay quite still, and strange as dreaming
He smiled as Lensky talked: the heady
He sweetened up with fancy's icing
He thought that Olga'd be confused,
He wakes -- and who is this who writes him?
He was a good and simple barin;6
He was convinced, a kindred creature
He was no fool; appreciated
He was sweet-natured, and yetwild.
He was the slave of a tenacious,
He was too young to have beenblighted
He was the son of the Comte de Saint-Priest, a French ?migr?.
He was without that dithyrambic
He who has lived and thought is certain
He'd brought back all the fruits of learning
He'd given up girls -- now gave up letters,
He's always with her: either seated
He's flown to Talon's,4 calculating
He's gone away and left his village,
He's here -- Monsieur Guillotmy friend.
He's neither died, nor lost his reason,
Heedless of the proud world'senjoyment,
Her eyes along the margin flitting
He's off -- this ruthless legislator
Her eyes were opened, and shesaid
Her feelings in their weary session
Her frightened cry brought running out
Her husband enters, thus concluding
Her loving spouse with approbation
Her passion burns with stronger powder

I acted thoughtlessly or not:you see, with tears and incantation
I am in love; leave me alone.And all the while the moon was shining
I ask you, each and every poet!
I buttonhole a wandering neighbour
I can see naught, as Hymen's foe,
I can't sleep, nyanya: it's so stifling!
I could describe here his attire;
I close. I dread to read thispage...
I count each hour the whole day through;
I do, I do. Well, where's he gone?''
I don't know why, but for my friend
I don't mean that she never shivered,
I don't see what's so bad about it.''
I drag my footsteps hither, yonder;
I dread your stern regard surmising
I feel a small foot in my hand;
I drop my hero... I'll be truthful:
I find no sense; the truth isthis,
I gave my word, alas, though now
I gave no rein to sweet affection:
I grasp a stirrup with affection,
I had most surely never reckoned
I have no leisure to recall;
I have to drag my feet to it.My pen, as once, no longer hurries
I hear you say. But can you see
I introduced my saucy Muse
I keep them, and will quote them here:
I kept in mind an ancient store
I know it all: my secret achewill anger you in its confession.
I know (and seek your exculpation)
I know it's now in your discretion
I know it, in the thoughts ofall
I know to what malicious laughter
I know, Godsent one, I'm protected
I lack the strength required to say
I like a friendly conversation,
I like to tell the time by dinner
I liked his quality, the dream
I longed, like every breaker hissing,
I love my Tatyana too much!
I love you (what's the use tohide
I married. I beseech you, go;I know your heart: it has a feeling
I meant to paint, with Alban's8 glory,
I might have said a word, andthen
I move in the grand monde? that rank,
I must translate -- there's no presuming --
I need to rest from all this rhyme:
I must wake up with the conviction
I never lived or wrote for praise;
I only write like this, you know,
I own it: tender Parny's12 rhyme
I pray God grant his soul salvation,
I put your genius to the testI make magnanimous confessionin other things you come off best:
I prize the attention of my friends,
I read with secret pain, and never
I really dote upon the word:
I reckon, by God's will. My Vanya
I roam by the secluded lake.
I regularly take much pleasure
I see another problem loomingto save the honour of our land
I shall set out on brand-new ways
I signal to each passing sailBeneath storm's vestment, on the seaway,
I suffered once from all the madness
I thank him without reservation,
I think I'm happy.'' Time to go,
I still find Gallicism delicious
I thought, she'll go this time, perhaps;
I too -- when I recall Svetlana5
I was Onegin's friend that season.
I walk the shore,17 I watch the weather,
I was just thirteen years of age.
I weep, and pray for your protection..,
I would have chosen none but you
I weep... In case there stillshould linger
I would have found a friend, another,
I would have had the indiscretion
I wouldn't be remotely human
I write to you -- no more confession
I write, my heart has ceased its pining,
I'd love you, but inside a day,
I'd not have known you, therefore I
I'd nothing to attract your humour...
I'll catalogue each simple saying
I'd still like dances to thisday:
I'll conjure up that swooningfashion
I'll end my tale some other time.
I'll feed the journalists fordinner
I'll float in gondola's seclusion;
I'll gladden your imaginationreader, by painting you a scene
I'll just remark, my verses talk
I'll part them, bring them back together;
I'll make them spar another round,
I'll say: with past ideals inview
I'll save this blossom on theshoot,
I'll set two ages by the earsXXXIV
I'll sprinkle you with holy water,
I'll stop that tempter from depraving
I'm altering my destination
I'm at your service to protect you;
I'm good for nothing now, my sweet...
I'm grieving still, but no more tears,
I'm much afraid that bilberrywine
I'm near to sobbing, near to weeping!...''
I'm old, my mind is blunted, Tanya;
I'm sick, my dear, I'm sick indeed.
I'm terrified -- so let it beTatyana's rites are not for me.
I'm wandering in a world of dreams...
I've drawn a plan and a projection,
I've dreams and years past resurrection;
I've known too many a haughtybeauty,
I'm yours, in a predestined fashion,
I've learnt new sadness; but in this
I've learnt the voice of new ambition,
I've no one here who comprehends me,
I've paid my due to classic art:
I've run a mile, I must avow,having decyphered on their brow
I've seen how, trustful in his blindness,
I've wasted too much life away!

Idle again by dedication,
Idol mio or Benedetta,
If Tanya'd had the chance of learning
If only Lensky'd known the burning
If suddenly aloft she spied
Imagine it: quite on my own
In French Onegin had perfected
In Tanya, what a transformation!
In backwoods, how d'you pass this season?
In days of carefree aspirations,
In duels a pedantic don,
In fact one day a note came flying
In heart's affairs, a sweet beginner,
In languid silence, or the flame
In love with fame, by freedomsmitten,
In passion's sluicing rain they freshen,
In second place the poet might
In stead of happiness, say I,custom's bestowed us from on high.
In summertime -- for he was leading
In swarms around Tatyana ranging,
In the dark sky, a shooting star
In the two sisters' rooms extended,
In the white heat of some dissension
In time past, objects of affection
In this, dear reader, if you know it,
In time, who knows, the agitation
In winter, when for longer time

November stood outside the door.
Now Latin's gone quite out offavour;
Now Nature's tremulous, pale effect
Now Tanya's groaning, now shes sighing;
Now all was still. Tatyana slept.
Now brooding thoughts hold his attention
Now don't suppose... let no suspicion...
Now for the first time she's escorted
Now he's returned, what role's he dancing?
Now hear the friends in dialogue:
Now here's a letter, as you see,
Now march.'' And calmly, not yet seeking
Now nearer... hooves... and in the yard
Now powder's greyish stream is slipping
Now she's alarmed; in desperate worry
Now that the British Muse is able
Now the mazurka sounds. Its thunder
Now, Lensky, would it be so bad
Now, faced with this enormousrevel,
Now, she devours, with what attention,
Now, to my cost it may be true

Olga's no life in her regard:the roundest face that you'veset eyes on,

Onegin knew enough to savour
Onegin looks with eyes of fire:
Onegin sits at table too,
Onegin spoke about its flights
Onegin swiftly came to know
Onegin too -- and there to see,
Onegin too. ``Good Lord, at last!''
Onegin turns, and with a shiver
Onegin was assessed by many

Onegin, d'you recall the day

Only from Tanya's heart, no cheering --

Only the ode, that solemn story!

Set in Intertype Lectura
Shade-like, in purposeless obsession
Shall I depict with expert knowledge
She dropped... ``It's he! Eugene arriving!
She dreamt of portents. In her dreaming
She enjoys the stately orchestration
She entered the deserted yardDogs, howling, rushed in her direction...
She faced him, questioning: `But you?...''
She folds the page, lays downthe plume.,
She hates a friendly voice's sound,
She hesitates, and doubts beset her:
She knows you?'' ``Why, we lived next door.''
She looked across, felt in her heart
She looks: forgotten past allchalking
She loved the balcony, the session
She sits with Nina8 at a table --
She sits down by the window-sill.
She struck one as the incarnation --
She wanders on without direction.
She was alone, lit by the moon.
She was like him and always sported
She was the one who looked asstill
She went -- and Eugene, all emotion,
She'll not see him, her obligation
She's dropped her sash's silken billow;
She's fallen in the snow -- alertly
She's here, she spreads abroad; she stipples
She's in the wood, the bear still trails her.
She's mine!'' Evgeny's voice of thunder
She's not in love?'' ``There's no one, ever.
She's paid the sunrise no attention,
Shishkov,6 forgive me: I don't know
Should your perfections be expended

Shy as a savage, silent, tearful,
Sign of the urge for domination:
Silence was everywhere enthralling;
Since earliest boyhood he haddoted
Since when is this?'' ``Two years or more.''
Sit down! how strange! it's like the stage
Slavonic god of love.
Smiling through sleep, natureis meeting
So Lensky wrote, obscurely, limply
So a disabled soldier-man,
So down came Tanya, hardly daring
So glut yourselves until you're sated
So let it be! for you to keepI trust my fate to your direction,
So let me with a kind expression
So my Zaretsky, as I said,
So now be off to Neva's brinkyou newborn work, and like a winner
So she was called Tatyana. Truly
So the poor butterfly will quiver
So there she stood, forlorn, deserted!
So to his wife for presentation
So to strange kinsfolk I was taken...
So went his sermon. Almost dying,
So, like Childe Harold, glum,unpleasing,
So, verse and prose, they came together.
Softly the door is opened, enter
Some days he's still in bed, and drowses,
Some neighbours there have come together;
Sometimes his tricks would earn him trouble,

Still as he was? has he stopped prancing?
Still blazing with resentments fuel,
Sometimes a landscape's represented,
Still for ever, fare thee well.
Still in the porch, exhaustedstupid,
Still on the board, the beakers hissed,
Still tumbling, devil, snake and Cupid
Straight up the chimney, pipes were smoking.
Street lamps go flashing by, and stalls,
Strike the ditty up, my sweets,
Such feckless passion -- as Ilive,
Such were a young rake's meditations --
Suddenly, from a crest, she sighted

Tatyana flushed, and started shaking.
Tatyana groaned above the tide;
Tatyana had a changeling lookin her own home. She never took
Tatyana had no dolls to dandle,
Tatyana heard Evgeny out.
Tatyana hears but takes no part;
Tatyana in a deep emotion
Tatyana listened with vexation
Tatyana leaves Onegin kneeling,
Tatyana looks with pulses racing
Tatyana looks, her faintness passes:
Tatyana lowered her regard
Tatyana never knew the attraction
Tatyana now need wait no longer.
Tatyana in low-cut attire
Tatyana pined in secret fashion:
Tatyana on; Miss Kharlikova,
Tatyana seeks to attune her ear,
Tatyana sees with trepidationwhat kind of thought, what observation,
Tatyana shared with full conviction
Tatyana simply lay in bed,
Tatyana struggles to run out she can't; and in her panic hurry

The brio of the Russian text partly depends on a lavish use not only of
The censor's tribute, I'll arrange:
The ch?teau was of a construction
The choirs of dancers sought their quarters.
The city's early sounds awakeher;
The clock of doom had struck as fated;
The comrade of so many days,
The crush, the heat, as musicblares,
The darkness thins away; but still
The days flew past; by now the season
The elegy's just vain protesting,
The fields are dark, since evening came.
The fire was dying; cinders faintly
The flirt has reason's cool volition;
The hall is full of noise andhustle,
The happiness of youth is dead,
The horses, as they sense thedead,
The house is packed out; scintillating,

The manor house, in deep seclusion,

The one you love's the younger daughter?''
The peasants there have wealth abounding,
The place where Eugene loathed his leisure
The poet's dead... already though
The ploughman there delights to doze,
The princess, sitting peaked and wan,
The protocol is all one wishes:
The rustic sage, in that apartment,
The sky breathed autumn, timewas flowing,
The sky is clear, the earth is frozen;
The storm is over,5 dawn is paling,
The tomcat, mannered and affected,
The two old ladies kiss and cry;
The week before Lent.
The world of fashion, prone to flatter,
The years incline to gloom and prosing,
The yard was bursting with dependants;
The years would pass; no longer youthful,
Their look, though, shows no change upon it --
Then doors are opened, Lenskyenters,
Their talk, so sound on everymatter,
Then in return for all this twaddle,
Then gradually upon sensationand thought, a sleepy numbness steals;
Then our Automedons are flashing,
Then send your grandson with this letter
Then verdicts from her husband's quartet
Then what resulted from the meeting?
Then with a half-ethereal splendour,
Then, after midday he'll be waking;
Then, crying, they untwined my plait,
Then, plunged in the housekeeper's day,
Then, in the backwoods, far from rumour
There came a murmur, for a fleeting
There many pages keep the impression
There once I too strolled back and forth:
There sings the nightingale, spring's lover,
There too, he honoured, hotlyweeping,
There was -- --,10 so notorious
There was a pine-branch downward straying
There you're entirely sure offinding
There's din of parting now that rages,
There's powdery snow up to her knees;
There's vacancies in plenty there.''
There, just in front of all that swarm,
There, with epigrammatic neatness,
These days I'm finding even gladness,
These figures from the world of seeming,
These lines and the first twelve lines of stanza XLVII were discarded
They buzz -- but then all talk's suspended --
They laugh. The guests begin arriving.
They should be forced to readin Russian,
They sing; unmoved by their sweet-sounding
They take her too to the Assembly.
They will receive us with delight.''
They're settled in; and crawling, sliding,
They've missed Eugene's completed etching.

Vladimir to this casual mention

Vladimir, wealthy and good-looking,
Wait, I'll present you -- butyou banish
Walking her horse in introspection
Walking? The country that youroam
Was it not in such sweet employment
Was it for you that I became
Was it to no effect that he,
Was she the Tanya he'd exhorted
We all meandered through our schooling
We all resemble more or less
We each enjoy a special hobbyeach of us has his favourite lobby:
We each have enemies in this world,
We must confess that taste deserts us
We too shall find our hour iswaiting;
We've many neighbours round about;
Well, I must make a frank confession,
Weltered in tears, and sorelysmarting,
Well-known restaurateur.'' Pushkin's note.
What ails him? he's in some strange daze!
Well, what?'' the neighbour says, ``he's killed.''
What breasts! What soul!... We'll go one day
What else? Quite drunk with love's illusion,
What do I want? what am I after,
What fate is my tomorrow brewing?
What folly! and what retribution!
What happened? Though his eyes were reading,
What if your pistol-shot has smitten
What in the world is more distressing
What nonsense, Tanya! in those other
What of it? Nothing. I'm justsending
What of them, Tanya? I was able,
What scorn I see in the expression
What power enslaves you, withyour seeming
What sort of roses, in your notion,
What trifling could be more complete?
What, Grandison? oh, Grandison!
What? Invitations? Yes, threehouses
Whatever for caprice of spending
Whatever in this rough confection
When Eugene's turn for salutation
When I defected from their union
When comes my moment to untether?
When out to burst a rival's bubble,
When progress and amelioration
When we draw a fellow in,
When we've retreated to the banner
When will the devil come for you?"''
Where are you? come -- and myown right
Whenever nyanya had collectedfor Olga, on the spreading lawn,
Where is the fire that once ignited,
Where to, God knows. The trail is dead.
Which one comes first? It's just the same
Whether the arrow has my number,
While Lensky'd long been meditating
While under the connubial banner
Whither, oh whither are ye banished,
Who could have looked the poet better,
Who in that flash could not have reckoned
Who in the princess for that second
Who is there who will truly measure
Who on earth is he? not... our hero?
What of it? it's euphonious, pleasant,
Who taught her an address so tender,
Who taught her all this mad, slapdash,
Who would have thought it?'' What an age!''
Who'll never fault our vices,or
Who'll sow no calumnies around us?
Who's not disgusted by cajoling,
Who? that fat general?'' Tanya cried.
Whom then to credit? Whom to treasure?
Whose fond attentions will astound us?
Whose glance, provoking inspiration,
Why did you visit us, but whyLost in our backwoods habitation
Why have you gone all pale and queasy?''
Why is Tatyana guiltier-seeming?
Why not?'' ``I'd choose the other quarter
Why then do you pursue me nowWhat cause has won me your attention?
Why, Tanya, what...?'' ``All's dull and trifling.
Why, pretty one, you're up already!
Wildly the fearful laughter pealed;
With a sharp epigram it's pleasant
Winter!... The countryman, enchanted,
With mounts from home, or postal station,
With reason, too: for when hed vetted
With spelling scrambled to perdition,
With that, in tears, and quite worn out,
With womankind, the less we love them,
Without romance, or false insistence,
Worse luck, Larina crawled; the employment
